On Friday 10th of December 2021, internet was set on fire. Or technically internet was full of flammable material and someone shared matches to everyone on that day. In this blog post, I will present my thoughts about the case.
TL;DR Do not flame the developers of Log4j or open-source stuff in general for this issue Always use the newest version of Log4j If patching or mitigating is not possible in short term, organizations should consider taking down the vulnerable service until it has been fixed Use default deny outbound Assume breach Happy hunting!</description></item></channel></rss>
