They release every year a hacker challenge and 50 first who solve it, get to buy the special &ldquo;hacker ticket&rdquo; with a cheaper price than a regular ticket. The badge that comes with the ticket is also visually different looking than a normal ticket. At the first I have to admit, this year the challenge was harder than in previous years. This was my third time I tried to do the challenge and the third time I managed to solve it. As the challenge started at the same weekend as Assembly LAN party was held, we decided to give it a try together with <a href=https://www.twitter.com/dist>Dist</a> and <a href=https://www.twitter.com/jaroneko>Jaroneko</a> as a team. There&rsquo;s probably multiple different ways to solve it but here&rsquo;s my take with some arguments why I did what I did. Hope you enjoy the read and even learn something from it!</p></blockquote><h1 id=_start>_start</h1><p>Disobey has a &ldquo;DISOBEY PUZZLE&rdquo; partition on their webpage with a link. When you click the link open, <a href=https://disobey2020.github.io/>Gitbub pages site</a> should open. GH pages are a way to host website from a github repo. Probably we can find something from <a href=https://github.com/disobey2020/disobey2020.github.io>Github</a> then&mldr;?</p><p>The repository was a lot different looking back then than it is today. People have made lot of pull requests and most of them have been accepted. This kinda makes the commit history harder to read but let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s in there. I cloned the repo and ran &ldquo;git log&rdquo; against it.</p><pre tabindex=0><code> whois@cypher → ~/gits/ → git clone https://github.com/disobey2020/disobey2020.github.io

</code></pre><p>Okay, so the retrieved password worked to keyhole and keyhole2 but not to keyholekeyhole2_pbkdf2. To be honest here, the decryption wasn&rsquo;t that smooth while doing the challenge first time. Organizers said bruteforcing is not needed in the challenge but at least I had to try [hard] all ciphers and digests before I managed to open the first keyhole. Also funny note, depending on the OpenSSL version default digest might be different. On OS X I had LibreSSL 2.8.3 which has SHA1 as defaul digest while on my Manjaro machine with OpenSSL 1.1.1d the default digest is SHA256.</p><h1 id=keyhole>keyhole</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s move forward. We have now two different files: somekind of sound file and a DOS/MBR boot sector. Let&rsquo;s start with the soundfile.</p><figure><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/sound/m%c3%b6rk%c3%b6.wav type=audio/mpeg></audio></figure><p>It plays nicely and sounds like a bogey (&ldquo;MÖRKÖ&rdquo;). :D It also sounds the tape is backwards so let&rsquo;s try to reverse it. As I don&rsquo;t know that much about signals and stuff and have only resolved these kind of challenges in CTFs, I will use noobfriendly tool Audacity for reversing. The reversing process was pretty easy in Audacity. Let&rsquo;s here what the mörkö has to say backwards.</p><figure><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/sound/m%c3%b6rk%c3%b6reversed.wav type=audio/mpeg></audio></figure><p>Sounds like the bogey is pronouncing some numbers right? Let&rsquo;s try to clear up the back noise so we can here what he has to say.</p><figure><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/sound/m%c3%b6rk%c3%b6cleaned.wav type=audio/mpeg></audio></figure><p>Alrighty, now we can here the numbers loud an clear. No matter how many times I listen it, I get the following sequence of numbers:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>1010101010568605568605568605379037968605
</code></pre><p>This sequence doesn&rsquo;t really return anything that makes sense. If we reverse the string and then turn it into ascii from hexa, we get some printable characters but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>whois@cypher → ~/gits/proof → ↑ master → echo &#34;1010101010568605568605568605379037968605&#34; |rev|xxd -r -p
Phis	sPhePhePhe%
</code></pre><p>This was the phase we were stuck for almost 36 hours&mldr; :D Those 36 hours were pretty long especially when we managed to solve the whole challenge in 4 days! BUT.. let&rsquo;s assume the first letter is &lsquo;T&rsquo; so that the string would start with a English word &lsquo;This&rsquo;. Hex value of capital &lsquo;T&rsquo; is 54. What if instead of &ldquo;ou&rdquo; the bogey is trying to say &ldquo;four&rdquo; ? Let&rsquo;s try that.</p><pre tabindex=0><code> whois@cypher → ~/gits/proof → ↑ master → echo &#34;1010101010568605568605568605379037968605&#34; |tr &#39;0&#39; &#39;4&#39;|rev|xxd -r -p
ThisIsTheTheTheAAAAA%
</code></pre><p>Boom!!! Looks like we solved the bogey and opened our first keyhole. Based on the keyhole names, this is probably the first part of a password that fits the keyholekeyhole2_pbkdf2. The password string also supports our story.</p><h1 id=keyhole2>keyhole2</h1><p>Now we get into the business: DOS/MBR boot sector image file. Oh boy, this is gonna be <a href=https://twitter.com/_k4m1_>K4M1</a> level good once again.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>whois@cypher → ~/gits/proof → ↑ master → file bootloader
bootloader: DOS/MBR boot sector
</code></pre><p>Running strings against the image just prints us a &ldquo;Invalid CPU!&rdquo;. I never though strings could tell us anything but it is always worth to try (protip: sometimes piping grep with strings is good as well, ping iiro). So let&rsquo;s roll up our sleeves and start debugging&mldr; As I happen to have access to IDA Pro, I used it for debugging. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter which debugger/disassembler you use&mldr; You can easily do the task with radare2 or ghidra. =)</p><p>So, the most common architectures what I have seen are ARM, i386, x86 and x64. As ARM emulating with QEMU did not work, I tried i386 and managed to run the program on my Windows virtual machine. I started QEMU with following parameters to enable multiple serials, allocate enough memory for it, to enable remote debugging and to pause execution at the start. Without pausing the execution, I got print &ldquo;WRONG&rdquo; on the serial0 console window.</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/qemu0.png alt=image></p><pre tabindex=0><code>C:\Users\Rodrigo Gonzales&gt;&#34;C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-i386.exe&#34; -drive format=raw,file=Desktop/bootloader -serial vc -serial vc -serial vc -serial vc -m 512 -S -s
</code></pre><p>Little googling about bootloaders gave a hint that bootloader should be initiazlied at 0x7C00. I set a breakpoint to that address and let the program continue. After getting there, I saw some kind of unpacking function starting&mldr; Single stepping was painful so I decided to let the program run for a while.</p><p>After stopping the software, I saw we ended up seeing the &ldquo;WRONG&rdquo; text in our serial0 and EIP was at 0x3028. The loop function at that location seemed to write some shit to addresses between 0x2328 and 0x303F. At the time, there was some still some ascii characters in addresses between 0x3000 and 0x3027. Now we roughly know that probably there&rsquo;s something in this address space. I decided to re-run the program and set breakpoint to 0x3000, which had hex-value 0x66 (ascii letter f) at this point.</p><p>The execution reached the breakpoint and oh boy, we can see assembly once again!!!</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida1.png alt=image></p><p>The first instructions don&rsquo;t look that interesting as it seems they are just defining some register values and checking CPU architecture. The jump to 0x303F takes us to start of the program.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>MEMORY:0000303F loc_303F:                               ; CODE XREF: MEMORY:00003010↑j

</code></pre><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/qemu1.png alt=image></p><p>At 0x304B program prints &ldquo;Place flag to 0x3000 in RAM please :)&rdquo;. After that AL is cleared with XOR and the execution continues. At 0x304F is suspicious jump instruction to function at 0x3051+1, which is not dissassembled in the IDA. Function at 0x3051 looks shady thou:</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida2.png alt=image></p><p>Let&rsquo;s try to undefine it and re-analyze with IDA.</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida3.png alt=image></p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida4.png alt=image></p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida5.png alt=image></p><p>After re-analyze the function looks a lot better. We can see that the program compares the first letter of the memory address 0x3000 to 0x42, which is letter B. If the first letter is not B (comparasion between AL and the first letter of our flag is not zero), the jump will be taken to loc_3114. That location is the place where the &ldquo;WRONG&rdquo; we saw first is written to the TTY.</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida6.png alt=image></p><p>Next instruction decreases value of AL by one so it becomes 0x41 (A). After that the second letter of our flag at byte_3001 is compared to AL value (0x41) and if they are equal, jump to loc_3114 (&ldquo;WRONG)&rdquo;) is taken.</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida7.png alt=image></p><p>At 0x307D next byte in our flag is re-compared to 0x42 (B). By that, we know that the first two letters in the flag are BB.</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida8.png alt=image></p><p>As we can see from the previous image, at 0x308A two bytes (word) from our flag are being loaded to EAX. These two bytes are the 5th and the 6th letter of our flag. AL register is the second part of EAX and compared first. As we can see from the instuctions, hex-value 32 is added to value of AL and then compared to 0x7B. This means our fifth letter is 0x7b ({) - 0x32 = 0x49 (I). Reversed flag so far: BB__I (__ are unknown letters at this point)</p><p>At 0x309D hex-value 20 is being reduced from the value of the first byte of our word and then compared to hex-value 54. By reversing this very hard mathematical function, we get the value 0x74 (0x54+0x20) which tranforms to ascii letter t. Reversed flag so far: BB__It</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida9.png alt=image></p><p>The next mov to AX is from word_3002. Then the register is being pushed and BX popped. This sequence copies the AX value to BX.</p><p>As we can see from the operand, the value of word_3002 can be calculated by undoing AND operation to 0x0202 with 0x0F0F.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
0000 1111 0000 1111
-------------------
0000 0010 0000 0010

--&gt;

1111 0010 1111 0010: F2F2
</code></pre><p>Let&rsquo;s continue. Next we compare the value stored to BX with similar function.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>MEMORY:000030B9 xor     bx, 202h
MEMORY:000030BE cmp     bx, 4040h
</code></pre><p>This time it&rsquo;s XOR instead of AND. Now we know that result of our BX value with 0x0202 should be 0x4040.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
0000 1111 0000 1111
-------------------
0100 0000 0100 0000

--&gt;

0100 0000 0100 0000: 4040
</code></pre><p>As we can see, the 3rd and 4th character are being compared in two different operations. By combining these two values we get 4242 (BB). Reversed flag so far: BBBBIt</p><p>Next the function at loc_3127 is being called. The function has some kind of loop, where the start address is 0x3000 and the end address 0x3157. The loop compares if any byte of the flag at 0x3000 has value 0xDA.</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida10.png alt=image></p><p>I set up a breakpoint to 0x3141 and the execution finally rechead it. We might need to come back here and continue debugging if the 0xDA should be in our flag. At this point I thought it&rsquo;s highly unlike as the Ascii value of 0xDA is Ú.</p><p>Return takes us back to 0x30CA where we jump to 0x30D1. At 0x30D1 our next characters gets loaded to EAX. Next the software increases AL value by one at 0x30D6. After that we jump to 0x30DE where the AL gets compared to 0x47 (G). As we just increased the value by 1, the 7th letter is 0x47 - 1 = 0x46 (F). Now we know the password starts BBBBItF.</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida11.png alt=image></p><p>Next the programn shifts EAX 8 bits with SHR. After that AL is being checked not to be 0x47 (G). As the jump is taken to WRONG only if letter equals to G, we can ignore the shr instruction at this point. In 0x30e9 AL is compared to 0x69 (i) and then the execution continues. By that i seems to be our 8th character. Reversed flag so far: BBBBItFi</p><p>The next part is once again kinda shady. We have a jump to loc_30EF+2 which is loc_30F1, how ever the dissassembled code does not show us this location. Let&rsquo;s try to jump there and then re-analyze the address.</p><p>Before:
<img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida12.png alt=image></p><p>After:
<img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida13.png alt=image></p><p>It worked =). At 0x30F1 latter word from EAX is shifted to AX and at 0x30F4 hex-values 0x73 and 0x74 are being compared to it. Hex-values 0x73 and 0x74 are ascii letters t and s. Reversed flag: BBBBItFits</p><p>After the operation, &ldquo;Correct&rdquo; is printed to TTY0 at 0x3106. At last we can try our reversed flag by inserting it to memory address 0x3000 and letting the program to execute.</p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/ida14.png alt=image></p><p><img src=https://blog.dfir.fi/assets/images/qemu2.png alt=image></p><p>Whoop whoop, thanks a lot @K4M1 for the fun ride!</p><h1 id=keyholekeyhole2_pbkdf2>keyholekeyhole2_pbkdf2</h1><p>If we combine the flags we got from keyhole and keyhole2, we get the assumed masterkey for the last known keyhole.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>ThisIsTheTheTheAAAAABBBBItFits
